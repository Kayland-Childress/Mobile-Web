        <!--Hello Thomas!-->
        <p>
          The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity
          is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the
          message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is
          about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a
          necessarily large amount of data.
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
          This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization
          and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized"
          chunks of data, as simplification usually does.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a
          time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once.
          Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information
          rather than the illumination of it.

          <img
            class="xx"
            alt="The Most Interesting Man in the World"

          />

          Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the
          information properly using HTML
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the
          &quot;title&quot; attribute.
        </h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Alt Attribute:</dt>
          <dd>
            The alt attribute is added when images are being displayed on a
            webpage. This displays a short discription of the image incase the
            image does not load on the site.
          </dd>
          <dt>Title Attribute:</dt>
          <dd>
            The title attribute adds a short discription to the viewer when
            hovering over a hyperlink. This gives them a better idea of where
            the link will take them if they click on it.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>
          Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from
          the dictionary
        </h4>
        <dl>
          <dt>Definition Term</dt>
          <dd>Blah blah blah blah.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4>
          Provide an example of a link pointing to your favorite site &amp;
          create a style rule to change the background color of the link when
          the user hovers over it.
